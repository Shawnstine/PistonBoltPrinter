# PistonBoltPrinter
fabric mod to curve and build piston bolt automatically
# How to use
with emtpy hands.
place slime block, and right click with empty mainhand. it will be start position.</br>
place honey block, and right click with empty mainhand. it will be 'direction', so slime -> honey is bolt direction. it can go straight, diagonal.</br>
right click at nothing with empty hands will toggle ON/OFF.</br>
Currently it requires carpet extra's accurateblockplacement (since it has to place piston reversed), but I can make it to lazy-place pistons, if you go 'back' the route. </br>
diagonal one requires you to go back and forth 2 times because it has 2 direction of pistons. </br>
Due to ping, server might not allow your fast block placement or something.. it currently places 120blocks per second at maxima.
