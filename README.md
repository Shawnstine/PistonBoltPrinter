# PistonBoltPrinter
fabric mod to curve and build piston bolt automatically
# How to use
with emtpy hands.
place slime block, and right click with empty mainhand. it will be start position.</br>
place honey block, and right click with empty mainhand. it will be 'direction', so slime -> honey is bolt direction. it can go straight, diagonal.</br>
right click at nothing with empty hands will toggle ON/OFF.</br>
Currently it requires carpet extra's accurateblockplacement (since it has to place piston reversed), but I can make it to lazy-place pistons, if you go 'back' the route. </br>
diagonal one requires you to go back and forth 2 times because it has 2 direction of pistons. </br>
Due to ping, server might not allow your fast block placement or something.. it currently places 120blocks per second at maxima.</br>
# Materials
materials are now hardcoded, for straight, you need pickaxe(eff 5), rails, smooth quartz, white carpet, repeater,piston, dust.</br>
for Diagonal, you need pickaxe, smooth quartz, sea lantern, rails, repeater, dust, sticky piston.
# How to build mod
download code zip and unzip somewhere. </br>
copy path and run cmd (windows), type cd <ctrl +V></br>
then type /gradlew build. if you want to change something, go to src folder and surf.
